Linear regression is one of the most common and interpretable statistical methods. This work aims to unfold some linear regression concepts, help approach and develop a linear regression problem step-by-step, make adjustments to fix issues, and interpret the model.

The concepts are skewness, kurtosis, Durbin-Watson test, heteroscedasticity, Breush-Pagan test, outliers, leverage, influence, Cook's distance, multicollinearity, and many more.  

In elaborating on the concepts, we will use a case to test if and how much variables such as continent, population, human development index (HDI), and rule of law (ROL) influence GDP Per Capita over the globe.

We used `statsmodels` and `Scipy` to do the analysis. For visualization, we used `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, and `IPyWidgets`.
